# random-password-machine

This script generates a random password based on user-selected options such as length and character types (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols). It builds a pool of allowed characters according to the selected settings, validates the input, and then constructs the final password by randomly selecting characters from the allowed set. The result is displayed in the console.
